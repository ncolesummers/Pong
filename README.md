3. For Windows Users, the project is already built and ready to play. Navigate to the `build` folder and run the `Pong.exe` file to play the game. Follow the steps in the "Building the Project" section below for all other platforms to build the project for your target platform.

## Building the Project

To build the game for your target platform, follow these steps:

3. Run the game: Once the build is complete, navigate to the build folder and run the executable file. Enjoy playing Pong!

## Contributing

7. Create a pull request: Once satisfied with your changes, push them to your forked repository and create a pull request on the original repository. Provide a clear description of your changes and any relevant information.

### IDE Recommendations

For development, we recommend using the following IDEs:

- [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/): In my experience, Rider has been the most reliable IDE for game development. It's free to all students with the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Visual Studio Code is currently the most popular IDE for development of all kinds. It is great to get started with, but it may require additional setup for Unity development.
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/): Visual Studio is the official IDE for Unity development. It is an excellent choice if you are learning IDEs and Unity simultaneously.

## Scripts

Please refer to the [Scripts](./Assets/Scripts.md) documentation for an overview of the scripts used in the project.
